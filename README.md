ParkingLot LowLeveLDesign
Here‚Äôs a clean LLD example for the ParkingLot system to help with your interview practice! Remember: your LLD design will depend on the specific requirements and areas your interviewer focuses on.

Design Description:
Chain-of-Responsibility Pattern is used to manage ParkingSpot assignment.

Use Chain-of-Responsibility (next) if:

 Managers have dynamic conditions (availability, size, priority).
You want to modify logic easily without touching core service code.
You need an extensible/pluggable system (follows Open/Closed Principle).

Use Map-based Lookup if:

Decisions are static based on vehicle type.
You need faster, simpler lookups.
Each type always maps to a single handler.



You can even combine approaches using a Map<VehicleType, HeadOfChain>.

Example:

FourWheelerCompactManager ‚Üí FourWheelerLargeManager ‚Üí OverflowManager

üìê Patterns Used:
Template Method Pattern to structure the Chain-of-Responsibility flow.
Command Pattern could be an alternative if you require Redo/Undo operations or async execution, but those were not needed here.
Strategy Pattern to select different algorithms to find free ParkingSpot
